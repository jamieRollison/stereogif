## Project Introduction
The Nimslo 3D is a camera with 4 lenses that takes 4 simultaneous exposures. When the images are developed digitally, they can be put together to make a 3D gif, but "putting together" requires manually making the gif in photoshop. Our project automates this process, with several customization tools and algorithms for developing these sorts of images and other stereoscopic imagery.

## System Overview
Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.

## Possible Challenges
A major hurdle will be representing JPG data in a way that can be modified, and outputting our modified data in the form of a GIF.
